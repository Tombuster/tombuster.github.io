# Introduction:
I'm Tom, nice to meet you!


## What I care about and enjoy:
I've got many interests, and the list is always growing! There are a couple staples, though. I've complied them into a list for your convenience!

- 3D art and rendering
- Film photography
- Tinkering with and driving my 1990 VW golf mk2 - It's a car you need to know how to drive, or how to put back together - usually both.
- Cooking all kinds of stuff, I particularly enjoy Japanese dishes
- Cyberpunk literature - I've become a big fan of [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson)'s sprawl trilogy - definitely check it out if that's your vibe! (Be careful of spoilers, though!)
- Music - I listen to a bunch of genres, usually depending on very specific *vibes*... here are some of my favourite songs and when I discovered them:
  - [Feeling It](https://open.spotify.com/track/3h45GAnateHR2KnCiZYOQA?si=e578e3954e6a4c76) by [Maximum Love](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6iDI0sHLIeFIkZk6BKJBVQ?si=YPLFchnQRQmi5jFlXLZjKQ), circa Nov 2023. All the music these guys put out is amazing, please go and have a listen when you find a bit of time to explore new music!
  - [Your Love (Déjà Vu)](https://open.spotify.com/track/5DYD4zlGiFlkpLaf2Bk8Vl?si=0e8413d244be495b) and [Heat Waves](https://open.spotify.com/track/6CDzDgIUqeDY5g8ujExx2f?si=7db8c3287cdf46b0) by [Glass Animals](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4yvcSjfu4PC0CYQyLy4wSq?si=xXa2YV3SRV25N-Sb_WYupg), circa Oct 2020 - I even got the cassette back then! (I was wholly unaware of Heat Waves' explosion on tiktok until my brother told me to put a different tape on! I avoid that platform like the plague, hence the song still remains one of my all-time favourites!)
  - [Resonance](https://open.spotify.com/track/1TuopWDIuDi1553081zvuU?si=0c13c708036f44f4) by [HOME](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2exebQUDoIoT0dXA8BcN1P?si=ccb9ydE9RJSeMrzgJWtilw), pre 2019 - I got the album on the now defunct google play music app in mid 2019 (that's when I noticed it available on that store) but listened to it long before that (around 2 years maybe?) on soundcloud and bandcamp iirc. I discovered it hrough [Swaggersouls](https://www.youtube.com/@SwaggerSouls)' videos' outros - the one he used lead me to discovering the whole Odyssey album, including the nowadays omnipresent Resonance!
  - [Space Boy](https://open.spotify.com/track/4P9oqOrFDijZRN7TWP4OUZ?si=5af667e199884ecd) and other Eurobeat tracks, ever since I remember. It's no surprise if you've read the anime section before this one. Surprisingly, my love for Eurobeat and Initial D grew separately.  One day, after coming back form high school, I booted up my old Xbox 360 for the first time in what would have been years, and  inserted the disc for Forza Motorsport 4 in order to try drifting - as a kid, I could never get a hang of it, so I figured I'd give it a shot then. I went scrolling through the menus to find a supra, but then an unassuming Sprinter Trueno showed up on the screen and I couldn't resist choosing it over the former. A year after that I learned of Initial D and its feature of the Tueno. As you might expect, I went on a wild goose chase to track down where I could watch the show, but came up empty-handed. Some time later I was browsing the series' subreddit when I noticed a post asking for links. The rest is sketchy russian websites and history. Nowadays, that site is defunct, but the anime is readily available online. I still have a zip of the 1st season on my desktop from the *good ol' days*, and later seasons on an old phone with a broken screen, waiting to be recovered someday...
  - [Grawitacja](https://open.spotify.com/track/6TCDk0HGWvvDCp5YnfN4rv?si=5d01fc7601f549e2) by [Lordofon](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7G3hAQixY7DIAGTgA2GU99?si=jv33mxyTS5OE40dg4wjxvw), circa Jan 2023. It's just got that vibe to it, y'know? This one preceeded a pretty shitty time in my life, but I've learned a lot from it, and this song sort of embodies that learning experience for me.
- I love 80s and 90s Anime - not only is it pretty, but the socioeconomic conditions around that period of time made for a fascinating change of perspective and topics! Some of my favourites you may recognize are:
  - Initial D
  - Neon Genesis Evangelion
  - Akira
  - Cowboy Bebop
  - Perfect Blue
  - Serial Experiments Lain
- Coding - I love problem solving with specific rule sets (oddly specific, I know, but I've noticed that this 'problems with specific rules' fromat carries over to things like algebra, the learning of which had brought me much enjoyment)
- Learning languages - now that I think about it, that's also covered by the whole 'specific rules' thing... Here are the languages I know:
  - Polish (Native)
  - English (Fluent, used almost as much as Polish)
  - Japanese (Studying since Nov 15 2021, a bit above N5 atm.)
  - Russian (Studied for 6 years, didn't enjoy it much but it was in the curriculum. At the time of writing this, it is being forgotten.)
- Virtual Reality - It's quite the magical experience for first-timers! I don't have much space and my computer can't really handle it anymore, but that's going to change soon!
- People - I love having my friends over at my place. I get to cook for people I care about and really there's not much better than that out there!

## Things I'm not too fond of:
- Big parties, lots of strangers and not many friends - I'm way too awkward in those kinds of situations, or rather I feel hemmed in and uncomfortable to the point of not being able to enjoy such a party.
- Inability to cut straight to the point - especially when it comes to dating. I'd much rather people had the courage to say 'no' to my face - if not I tend to overthink and fall into a destructive spiral that rips the already existing relationship apart and makes me think I'm doing things wrong. I know that it can be difficult to 'just say things outright', but I try to make it as easy as possible for the other person. 
- Non-constructive unprompted criticism - especially if it's really petty, completely pointless, or just unrelated to me whatsoever. Getting ripped into in this way is one of tne worst feelings in my feelings ranking list.
